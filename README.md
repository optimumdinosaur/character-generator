# character-generator

Run characterDisplay.py to start up the GUI. From there you can specify how the character is generated. You can check any nonzero number of the 8 race boxes: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Orc, Halfling, Human, and Kobold. You may also specify the class. There are 16 options: Ardent, Barbarian, Bard, Beguiler, Crusader, Dread Necromancer, Druid, Fighter, Paladin, Psion, Ranger, Rogue, Swordsage, Warblade, and Wilder. All non-psionic classes are Pathfinder versions if available. This means that Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, and Rogue are the versions from Pathfinder. Ardent, Crusader, Dread Necromancer, Psion, Swordsage, Warblade, and Wilder are from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5. 
characterGenerator.py is the generator itself.
